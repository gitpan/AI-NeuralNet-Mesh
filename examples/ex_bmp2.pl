	Desc: 

		This demonstrates the ability of a neural net 
		to generalize and predict what the correct 
		result is for inputs that it has never seen before.
				
		This teaches a network to recognize a 5x7 bitmap of 
		the letter "J" then it presents the network with a 
		corrupted "J" and displays the results of the networks 
		output.
